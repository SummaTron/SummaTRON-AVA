          <!-- What is SummaTRON -->
			<div class="card my-4">
  				<h5 class="card-header">What are the SummaTRON used for?</h5>
				<div class="card-body">
				<p style="text-align:justify">
				SUMMATRON-API allows a company to identify its users if they send a text generated by the server and that they must send the company through the TRON network. <br>
				<br>
				In order for the text to be sent in the message to be sufficiently versatile, it is necessary that each company that uses the API generates a different text for it, it must send a SummaTRON to the project account and indicating in the description of the shipment the name of the company. < br>
				To achieve this purpose, a specific token is required, and for this we have created SummaTRON, and only 1 SummaTRON is necessary to perform this operation. <br>
				<br>
				SummaTRON is an instrumental token, not a cryptocurrency for the payment of the service. That's why 10 million IdTronix have been created at a price of 1 SummaTRON for 1 TRX. <br>
				<br>
				The goal is for SUMMATRON-API to replace the use of SMS or Google Authenticator, on the one hand for the cost and on the other, for the ease of use by not having to type the code but read a QR. <br>
				<br>
				A company that implements SUMMATRON-API, must buy some IdTronix, can distribute them among its users and when they use them they will return to their TRON account. <br>
				The goal is for the process to be quick, easy and cheap. Right now the price of an IdTronix would be € 0.00002 (the price of an SMS is € 0.1).
				<br>
				SUMMATRON-API can allow many companies to improve their identification system, if you want to test the API, <b> we will send you 1 SummaTRON and 1,000 IdTronix to your account. </b> <br>
				Just send any token to the account: <b> TFQwLDzUvEc99ktd3TvUc9g3uATGmX2fS7 </b> (the SummaTRON project account), indicating in the Description: I trust in SummaTRON-API. Include a description is necessary to distinguish this transfer of all shipments of fake tokens. <br>				<br>

          <!-- QUe es SummaTRON-AVA -->
			<div class="card my-4">
  				<h5 class="card-header">What is SummaTRON-AVA?</h5>
				<div class="card-body">
				<p style="text-align:justify">
				SUMMATRON-AVA (Account Viewer Aggregator) is an implementation of the use of SummaTRON-API. It is displayed on the initial screen of www.summatron.com. <br>
				<br>
				Taking advantage of API identification functionality, you can access the information of the TRON account you access. <br>
				<br> <br>
				As an added value SUMMATRON-AVA allows the linking of several accounts to be seen together. In order to link them, a SummaTRON will be sent from the account that is used in the wallet to each of the accounts that they want to link. <br>
				<br> <br>
				Therefore, you must acquire as many SummaTRON as accounts you want to link. <br>
				<br> <br>
				If you also want to know the profitability of your investment, you can send 1 SummaTRON to the project account: <b> TFQwLDzUvEc99ktd3TvUc9g3uATGmX2fS7 </b>, indicating in the description the amount of the investment with the symbol $ o €.
				<br> <br>
				And what is the advantage of using SUMMATRON-AVA? You can know all the information of several accounts in an integrated way. Also if you use Windows, use the private key of the TRON account on tronscan.org, you may have the risk of being "stolen". <br>
				<br> <br>
				SummaTRON-AVA can evaluate your profitability, both for TRXs and other tokens when they start trading. <br>
				There are already more than 500,000 TRX accounts, and many users have more than one account, the operations account in the wallet and the investment account. With SummaTRON-AVA, you can navigate through the investment account identifying yourself with the wallet account.<br>				</p>
