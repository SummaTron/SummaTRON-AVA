					<h1>SummaTRON-API</h1>
					<p style="text-align:justify">
					Access API to the identification system created by SummaTRON, type 2FA and based on the TRON Blockchain to improve the identification of users on the web pages.
					<br><br>
					There are more than 1.06 billion web pages and more than 28 million registered web domains. The SummaTRON API wants to help simplify and increase the security of pages with user identification. 
					<br><br>
					The identification API works with a 2FA system, double factor identification, based on the fact that a user who has a TRON account in a wallet and sends an ITX Token to another account, can only be him. If you have lost control of your account, you have lost your identity and its content (equivalent to losing a digital certificate along with the password).
					<br><br>
					On the option <a href="https://www.summatron.com/AVA.html" target="_blank">AVA</a> you can test the operation. Sending 1 IdTronix you can see your account information without having to use the private key. This way if you use Windows it would not be necessary to type anything. It works like browsing Tronscan, but without typing the private key. Does not replace wallet functionality: shipping or payment. <br>
					<br>
					Based on this premise, any company that has or wants to implement a user identification system can use user and password: SMS, Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, etc., SummaTRON will be a similar and even more simple method. <br>
					<br>
					For example, a company that wants to use it only has to integrate the API and register, which means: <br>
					<br>
					<ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
					<li class="list-group-item">
					<p style="text-align:justify">
					1) Create or have a TRON account, you must buy 1 SummaTRON and the IdTronix that you think is necessary for your number of users, its price is 0.001 TRX. <br>
					</p>
					</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">
					<p style="text-align:justify">
					2) The registration process consists in sending the SummaTRON to the project account: TFQwLDzUvEc99ktd3TvUc9g3uATGmX2fS7, and very important in the description indicate the name of the web, for example: <b>EmpresaXX</b>. <br>
					</p>
					</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">
					<p style="text-align:justify">
					3) Initiate your users to install a wallet (TronWalletMe has the PAY option that streamlines the process by scanning all the data at once). <br>
					</p>
					</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">
					<p style="text-align:justify">
					4) In the installation of the wallet, users will create a TRX account. <br>
					</p>
					</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">
					<p style="text-align:justify">
					5) On the web users must register that TRX account, which will be used to identify themselves. <br>
					</p>
					</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">
					<p style="text-align:justify">
					6) The company will send some ITX to that account so that the user initially does not have to do anything, and can already use them to identify themselves. <br>
					</p>
					</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">
					<p style="text-align:justify">
					7) The user when he wants to enter the website (which will have already implemented the SummaTROn API) will show QRs, scan and send an ITX that will go to the company's own account, so the company will only need to buy more ITX if increase your customers. <br>
					</p>
					</li>
					</ul> <br>
					If the TRON System succeeds and the use of cryptocurrencies and wallet is generalized, the same users can buy the ITX, otherwise the company would move all that it buys among its clients, it will need as many as daily identifications. More activity, more ITX than you need, but the cost compared to SMS is 100,000 less, since ITX are reusable. <br>
					</ br>
					As examples of use we have developed a TRX account aggregator, <a href="https://www.summatron.com/index.html" target="_blank"> SummaTRON </a> (Summa all in Latin and TRON) and an e-commerce that we have called <a href="https://www.summatron.com/shop/index.html" target="_blank"> SHOP </a> where users can buy digital products through TRX and register your own products. <br> <br>
					</p>
					<br><br>
					The next image show how the API works, and above we explain how to insert it in your web page code.<br>
					<br>
					</p>	
					<div><img class = "img-fluid redondeado" style = "border: 1px solid gray" src="/tron/img/EsquemaSummaTRON-API.png"/></div>
					<br>
					<p>For inseting the API at the web page, include this code</p>
					<p>(You can see all the information at <a href="https://github.com/SummaTron/SummaTRON-API" target="_blank">https://github.com/SummaTron/SummaTRON-API</a> )</p>
					<p>In the HEAD <br></p>
					<pre>
	<code style="color:grey">
	&lt;script src="jquery-qrcode-0.14.0.min.js" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;
	&lt;script src="/api/js/apisummatron.js" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	</code>
					</pre>
					<p>In the BODY, where you want to show the QR for control the access<br></p>
					<pre>
	<code style="color:grey">
	&lt;div id="PanelIRS" style="display:block;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
	//With this css style  control then QR visible or not.
	</code>
					</pre>
					<p>At the end of the HTML insert this <br></p>
					<pre>
	<code style="color:grey">  
	&lt;script&gt;
	   $("#PanelIRS").load("/api/PanelIRS.html", function() {
	   sCuenta = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
	   Verificar(sCuenta,"EN", "FUNCTION to EXECUTE");
	   });
	&lt;/script&gt;
	</code>
					</pre>
					With this script, the QR is displayed and the TRON account of the company is indicated. <br>
					In FUNCTION to EXECUTE from, you must indicate the name of the function that will be executed when the identification ends, it is returned as
					parameter the TRON account, or an empty string, if after 60 seconds the identification has no occurred. <br>
					<br>
					<b> VERY IMPORTANT </b> <br>
					<br>
					In order to use SummaTRON-API you must register the name of the company that will be used as part of the key that is sent in the identification process. <br>
					<br>
					This process is done by sending 1 SummaTRON from the company's account, which must then be included in the call to the Verify () function, to the project account: <b> <br>
					TFQwLDzUvEc99ktd3TvUc9g3uATGmX2fS7 </b>, and it is very important, indicate in the Description the name of the company, we suggest that it is the domain without www or .com.
					<br> <br>
					You can buy the Summatron at <a href="https://tronscan.org/#/tokens/list?search=SummaTRON" target="_blank"> https://tronscan.org/#/tokens/list?search=SummaTRON</a>, 1 TRX = 1 SummaTRON.
					<br> <br>
					You can buy IdTronix at <a href="https://tronscan.org/#/tokens/list?search=IdTronix" target="_blank"> https://tronscan.org/#/tokens/list?search=IdTronix</a>, 1 TRX = 1,000 IdTronix.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p style = "text-align: justify">
					<b> UPCOMING VERSIONS </b>
					<br><br>
					We are developing a control console to manage the users who register on the website and how many times they have been identified. <br>
					It also allows controlling the number of tokens: IdTronix and SummaTRON, which has each of its accounts, being able to reload its content. <br>
					In the following link you can see the Beta version: <a href="https://www.summatron.com/console.html" target="_blank"> Console </a>
					<br> <br>
					All the functions of this console are based on Tron.Network, so the company does not have to save information in its databases. <br>
					The evolution of the console will allow: to know the number of accesses, time slots, flow of users, etc., always using statistical data.
					<br> <br>
					Users can change their personal data in IdTron and communicate it to all companies where they have registered. SummaTRON-API will allow to pick up the latest updated version.

				<h5 class="card-header">Why TRON?</h5>
				<div class="card-body">
					<p style="text-align:justify">
						Currently a large amount of user information and internet traffic is concentrated in a few corporations such as Google, Facebook, Amazon and Snapchat. <b>TRON</b> tries to mitigate this control by giving ownership of the information returned to its creators.<br>
						<br>
						<b>TRON</b> is open and decentralized platform and distributed storage technology will allow digital content creators to eliminate intermediaries such as Apple Store and Google Play. In this way content producers obtain their profits directly from consumers, without intermediaries.<br>
						<br>
						<br>Electronic books, music, photos, articles, etc. they can be easily marketed without intermediaries to make the payment.<br>
						<br>
						Banks, Visa, Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc. they take much of the amount of operations, basically because until now there was no alternative.<br>
						<br>
						The transactions carried out in TRON are traceable, through <a href="http://tronscan.org" target="_blank">Tronscan.org<a>, the 2 participants in the purchase / sale can see the result of the operation.<br>
						<br>
						This functionality replaces the need to contact your bank or Visa, when a transaction is "lost". But it does not replace the possible scammers, <b>TRON</b> improves technology, not the morality of people.
						<br>
						In <a href="http://www.summatron.com/shop" target="_blank">Shop</a> you can see an example of how to sell an e-book without registration, payment gateway or cookies "to improve the experience".<br>
						<br>

			<div class="card my-4">
				<h5 class = "card-header"> How to use TRON? </h5>
            	<div class = "card-body">
					<p style = "text-align: justify">
						TRON was born with the aim of assembling an architecture based on blockchain and that manages to execute 10,000 transactions per second. <br>
						Its currency is called Tronix (TRX), and 100,000 million have been issued. <br>
						<br>
						The TRXs are stored in an electronic wallet, wallet in English. Wallet for mobile, allow Payment, Sending or reception of TRX with other accounts in trones. <br>
						<br>
						With this capacity it can be used as a means of payment in all types of transactions, but also as a form of identification without the need for registration, since only the user has access to his TRX account. <br> <br>
						<br>
						A System capable of executing operations in less than 1 second has a multitude of utilities. In <a href="http://www.summatron.com/shop" target="_blank"> Shop </a> you can try a purchase / sale system without registration,
						with immediate payment without the need for credit cards, and with the possibility of registering and modifying the information of a product safely only by the creator. <br>
						It's Internet 4.0, out of control of Facebook, Google or Amazon.
