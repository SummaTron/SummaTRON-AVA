				In this pages we are going  to explain the operation of SummaTRON-API and the process of identification, registration and signing of documents that this project allows is described below.
				The objective of this project is to replace the current identification mechanisms used by web pages, such as user / password and 2FA based on SMS or email.
				<br>
				The registration process is repetitive and heavy, since the information required by the web pages are very similar. In addition, the reference to which pages have been registered and what password is used in each case is lost.
				SummaTRON proposes a system based on the TRON account and its characteristics of public key and private key.
				<br>
				For this, SummaTRON has developed an API, a DApp (download here the Android version of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.apache.cordova.IdTron&hl=es" target="_blank">IdTron</a>), and two tokens: IdTronix and SummaTron.

            <h5 class="card-header">Why TRON?</h5>
            <div class="card-body">
			<p style="text-align:justify">
			Currently a large amount of user information and internet traffic is concentrated in a few corporations such as Google, Facebook, Amazon and Snapchat. <b>TRON</b> tries to mitigate this control by giving ownership of the information returned to its creators.<br>
			<br>
			<b>TRON</b> is open and decentralized platform and distributed storage technology will allow digital content creators to eliminate intermediaries such as Apple Store and Google Play. In this way content producers obtain their profits directly from consumers, without intermediaries.<br>
			<br>
			<br>Electronic books, music, photos, articles, etc. they can be easily marketed without intermediaries to make the payment.<br>
			<br>
			Banks, Visa, Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc. they take much of the amount of operations, basically because until now there was no alternative.<br>
			<br>
			The transactions carried out in TRON are traceable, through <a href="http://tronscan.org" target="_blank">Tronscan.org<a>, the 2 participants in the purchase / sale can see the result of the operation.<br>
			<br>
			This functionality replaces the need to contact your bank or Visa, when a transaction is "lost". But it does not replace the possible scammers, <b>TRON</b> improves technology, not the morality of people.
			<br>
			In <a href="http://www.summatron.com/shop" target="_blank">Shop</a> you can see an example of how to sell an e-book without registration, payment gateway or cookies "to improve the experience".<br>

			Keep in mind that investing in Cryptocurrency is a risk, more than 80% of investors lose money.<br>
			These instructions tell you how to proceed if you want to investigate how e-commerce will work in a few years, it is not a purchase recommendation.<br>
			<br> Except for the initial purchase, the process of using TRX is very simple. If several friends want to have TRX, it is enough for one of them to buy the TRX and then send them a TRX.
			<br> Today there are very few sites to pay with TRX, but keep in mind that when Amazon started, I had a few books or Netflix a few movies.
