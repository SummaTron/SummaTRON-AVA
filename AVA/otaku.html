			<h4> Donation procedure </h4>
			<br>
			<p style = "text-align: justify">
			On this page we will explain how to make donations to Otakubrosreviews reviews. <br><br>
			It is simpler than it seems and will also allow you to enter the world of cryptocurrency. <br><br>
			Many people know Bitcoin today but when the project was born in 2009 very few bet on this new modena, in fact the creators are anonymous,
			If you want to know more about Bitcoin puesde <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historia_del_bitcoin" target="_blank"> access wikipedia. </a><br>
			The project on which Bitcoin is based, is something more than a cryptocurrency, is a new communication system between two participants called blockchain, and that will revolutionize the Internet. <br> <br>
			After Bitcoin, many other cryptocurrencies have appeared, each with a different objective: Etherum, Ripple, EOS, etc. <br>
			We have chosen to bet on TRON, its objective is to create a distributed system based blockchain and capable of executing 10,000 transactions per second, with this speed it intends to be the currency of exchange of digital contents,
			network games, entertainment, etc. It was created by Justin Sun creator of Peiwo (the Chinese Snapchat that has 50 million users).<br>
			To learn more about what TRON is, access its home page <a href="https://www.tron.netwok" target="_blank"> Tron.network </a>.<br>
			<br> <br>
			On the homepage you can find the <a href="http://www.summatron.com" target="_blank"> general guide for buying TRON and storing them on a wallet. </a><br>
			<br> <br>
			In this page we will tell how a donation is made.

            <h5 class="card-header">Why TRON?</h5>
            <div class="card-body">
			<p style="text-align:justify">
			Currently a large amount of user information and internet traffic is concentrated in a few corporations such as Google, Facebook, Amazon and Snapchat. <b>TRON</b> tries to mitigate this control by giving ownership of the information returned to its creators.<br>
			<br>
			<b>TRON</b> is open and decentralized platform and distributed storage technology will allow digital content creators to eliminate intermediaries such as Apple Store and Google Play. In this way content producers obtain their profits directly from consumers, without intermediaries.<br>
			<br>
			<br>Electronic books, music, photos, articles, etc. they can be easily marketed without intermediaries to make the payment.<br>
			<br>
			Banks, Visa, Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc. they take much of the amount of operations, basically because until now there was no alternative.<br>
			<br>
			The transactions carried out in TRON are traceable, through <a href="http://tronscan.org" target="_blank">Tronscan.org<a>, the 2 participants in the purchase / sale can see the result of the operation.<br>
			<br>
			This functionality replaces the need to contact your bank or Visa, when a transaction is "lost". But it does not replace the possible scammers, <b>TRON</b> improves technology, not the morality of people.
			<br>
			In <a href="http://www.summatron.com/shop" target="_blank">Shop</a> you can see an example of how to sell an e-book without registration, payment gateway or cookies "to improve the experience".<br>

         <div class="card my-4">
            <h5 class="card-header">Very Important</h5>
            <div class="card-body">
			<p style="text-align:justify">
			Keep in mind that investing in Cryptocurrency is a risk, more than 80% of investors lose money.<br>
			These instructions tell you how to proceed if you want to investigate how e-commerce will work in a few years, it is not a purchase recommendation.<br>
			<br> Except for the initial purchase, the process of using TRX is very simple. If several friends want to have TRX, it is enough for one of them to buy the TRX and then send them a TRX.
			<br> Today there are very few sites to pay with TRX, but keep in mind that when Amazon started, I had a few books or Netflix a few movies.
