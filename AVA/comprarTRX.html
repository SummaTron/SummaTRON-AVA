				<h4>Summatron: Prototyping the future e-Commerce</h4>
				<br>
				<p style="text-align:justify">
				In order to know the TRON project, at least 3 things are necessary: ​​knowing what it is TRON, how to buy TRX and how to use them.<br>
				<br>
				To learn more about what TRON is, access its main <a href="https://www.tron.netwok" target="_blank">tron.netwok</a> page.<br>
				<br>
				Basically TRON is an open and decentralized platform, based on blockchain. On this page are some instructions to learn how to buy TRX.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Very important:</b> this page is not an investment recommendation, just a guide to know a way to enter the world of cryptocurrencies.<br>
				<br>
				Finally, if you have TRX in your digital wallet (wallet), the most important thing remains: how are they used? In the <a href="http://www.summatron.com/shop" target="_blank">Shop</a>, you can test how the future e-commerce will be.<br>
				<br>
				<a href="http://www.summatron.com/shop" target="_blank">Summatron.com/Shop</a> is possibly the first prototype of how to buy digital products using TRX: ebooks, music, videos, images, drawings, documents, etc. in a direct way between creator and client,<br>
				<br>
				The creator registers a product in Shop indicating his TRX account, the customer enters Shop chooses a product and pays it with his wallet (Shop shows the TRX account of the creator does not act as an intermediary of the payment), after verifying the payment (some second thanks the TRON network), Shop allows the download of the product. It's that simple and direct.<br>

			<p style="text-align:justify">
			Currently a large amount of user information and internet traffic is concentrated in a few corporations such as Google, Facebook, Amazon and Snapchat. <b>TRON</b> tries to mitigate this control by giving ownership of the information returned to its creators.<br>
			<br>
			<b>TRON</b> is open and decentralized platform and distributed storage technology will allow digital content creators to eliminate intermediaries such as Apple Store and Google Play. In this way content producers obtain their profits directly from consumers, without intermediaries.<br>
			<br>
			<br>Electronic books, music, photos, articles, etc. they can be easily marketed without intermediaries to make the payment.<br>
			<br>
			Banks, Visa, Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc. they take much of the amount of operations, basically because until now there was no alternative.<br>
			<br>
			The transactions carried out in TRON are traceable, through <a href="http://tronscan.org" target="_blank">Tronscan.org<a>, the 2 participants in the purchase / sale can see the result of the operation.<br>
			<br>
			This functionality replaces the need to contact your bank or Visa, when a transaction is "lost". But it does not replace the possible scammers, <b>TRON</b> improves technology, not the morality of people.
